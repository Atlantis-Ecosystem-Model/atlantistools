Description: Atlantis is an end-to-end marine ecosystem modelling framework. It was originally developed
in Australia by E.A. Fulton and A.D.M. Smith (2007) and has since been adopted in many marine ecosystems
arround the world (http://atlantis.cmar.csiro.au/www/en/atlantis.html). 
The output of an Atlantis simulation is stored in various file formats like
netcdf, txt and different output structures are used for various output variables like e.g. 
productivity or biomass. Atlantistools is used to convert these various output types to a unified format
according to the tidy-dataframe approach by Wickham (2014). Additionally, ecological metrics like for example spatial
overlap of predator and prey or consumption can be calculated and visualised with atlantistools. Due to the
unified data structure it is very easy to share model output with each other and perform model comparisons.
