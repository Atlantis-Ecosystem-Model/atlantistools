# atlantistools 0.0.0.9000

## New features

* `load_fgs()` Read in the functional group file as dataframe.
* `load_bps()` Extracts the names of the epibenthic biomasspools from the initial conditions file.
* `load_box()` Load the box specification file (*.bgm) for an Atlantis scenario.
* `load_nc()` Read in data from Atlantis netcdf output files. Currently the general and the 
production outputfile are supported. In addition the following variables can be read in:
"N", "Nums", "ResN", "StructN", "Eat", "Growth", "Prodn" and "Grazing". Please only pass one
variable per function call. 
* `load_nc_physics()` Read in physical data from Atlantis netcdf output file. Works very
similar like load_nc.
* `plot_calibrate()` Plot relative timeseries of various variables (E.g. biomass@age, 
weight@age). The start of the model run is used as reference point.
* `preprocess()` Various model specifications are read in from the ncdf-output files
and aggregated with different levels of complexity. (E.g. biomass per species, time and ageclass
or biomass per species, time and box). The data can be stored in a *.rda file to save
storage on harddisc. The function returns a list of dataframes which all have the same structure.
This function should be executed before you start plotting as most of the plotting routines 
pull out the data from this file/object.
* `agg_mean()` Aggregate data using dplyr functionality. This is basically a wrapper
for 'group_by' followed by 'summarise'.
* `agg_sum()` See 'agg_mean' for further details. The summary function used her is 'sum'.

## Documentation improvements

## Minor improvements

* `convert_path()` Allows users to use the model with either one model folder or multiple
model folders (e.g. one main model folder and an extra folder for model output). I highly 
recommend to store all the data in one folder because then you only have to supply the
directory once and can acces all files using only the filename. If you are using multiple
files you always have to pass the complete folder/filename-string as filename and set
the 'dir' paramater to NULL.
* `get_boundary()` Extract the boundary boxes from the list of boxinfos generated with 'load_box()'. 
* `get_conv_mgnbiot()` Extract the factor to convert data from mg nitrogen to biomass in t
from the biol*.prm file.
* `get_groups()` Collection of similar functions which get specific
#' columns from the Atlantis functionalGroups.csv file. (E.g. cohort-groups, acronyms, ...)
