# atlantistools 0.1.0.9000

## New features

* `plot_bench()` 
* `plot_boxes()` 
* `plot_calibrate()` 
* `plot_dietcheck()` 
* `plot_flux()` 
* `plot_physics()` 
* `plot_rec()` 
* `plot_struct()` 
* `plot_ts()` 

# atlantistools 0.0.0.9000

## New features

* `load_fgs()` Read in the functional group file as dataframe.
* `load_bps()` Extracts the names of the epibenthic biomasspools from the initial conditions file.
* `load_box()` Load the box specification file (*.bgm) for an Atlantis scenario.
* `load_nc()` Read in data from Atlantis netcdf output files. Currently the general and the 
production outputfile are supported. In addition the following variables can be read in:
"N", "Nums", "ResN", "StructN", "Eat", "Growth", "Prodn" and "Grazing". Please only pass one
variable per function call. 
* `load_nc_physics()` Read in physical data from Atlantis netcdf output file. Works very
similar like load_nc.
* `load_dietcheck()` Read in data from the `DietCheck.txt` output file. Currently only models based on the
`bec_dev` branch are supported due to differences in data structure with `trunc` models.
* `load_rec()` Read in data from the `*SSB.txt` and `*YOY.txt` output files. 
* `plot_calibrate()` Plot relative timeseries of various variables (E.g. biomass@age, 
weight@age). The start of the model run is used as reference point.
* `preprocess()` Various model specifications are read in from the ncdf-output files
and aggregated with different levels of complexity. (E.g. biomass per species, time and ageclass
or biomass per species, time and box). The data can be stored in a *.rda file to save
storage on harddisc. The function returns a list of dataframes which all have the same structure.
This function should be executed before you start plotting as most of the plotting routines 
pull out the data from this file/object.
* `agg_mean()` Aggregate data using dplyr functionality. This is basically a wrapper
for 'group_by' followed by 'summarise'.
* `agg_sum()` See 'agg_mean' for further details. The summary function used her is 'sum'.

## Minor improvements

* `convert_path()` Allows users to use the model with either one model folder or multiple
model folders (e.g. one main model folder and an extra folder for model output). I highly 
recommend to store all the data in one folder because then you only have to supply the
directory once and can acces all files using only the filename. If you are using multiple
files you always have to pass the complete folder/filename-string as filename and set
the 'dir' paramater to NULL.
* `convert_bgm()` Convert `*.bgm` file to a dataframe using a spatial projection.
* `convert_factor()` Convert species names in output files to long names. Therefore the plots all
use the same labeling. Simply change the values in your `functionalGroups.csv` file in the column `LongName` 
if you want to change the names.
* `convert_time()` Convert from timestep (either as integer or number of days) to actual time.
* `get_boundary()` Extract the boundary boxes from the list of boxinfos generated with 'load_box()'. 
* `get_conv_mgnbiot()` Extract the conversionfactor to convert data from mg nitrogen to biomass in t
from the biol*.prm file.
* `get_groups()` Collection of similar functions to extract specific
#' columns from the Atlantis functionalGroups.csv file. (E.g. cohort-groups, acronyms, group names ...)
* `theme_atlantis` Customised ggplot2 theme used in every plot.
