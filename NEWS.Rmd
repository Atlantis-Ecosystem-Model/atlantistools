# atlantistools 0.3.2.9000
## New features
* `check_growth()` helps to track changes in group- and age specific individual weight over time.
You can either track the maximum relative change in individual weight over the whole simulation
period or the relative change within each year (in case you have mukltiple outputs per year. Other
wise the result will be 0 by default). This will allow you to easily track if individual weight is 
consistent with provided input weights throughout the simulation.
* `plot_diet()` new version of `plot_diet` only works with trunk models. Please use `plot_diet_bec_dev`
for bec_dev models. `plot_diet()` now displays the realised diet contribution (both per predator and
prey perspective). Please note, `plot_diet_bec_dev` does not work with DietCheck.txt anymore. Please
use SpecPredMort.txt instead. It should be noted that the resulting plot only gives an indication of the 
realisd diets with bec_dev models.
* `biomass_flow` calculate the consumed biomass in [t] per timestep of prey species j by predator i with 
ageclass k. These values are used in `plot_diet()` to visualise the actual realised diet within the model.
Please use identical output timesteps for *.nc and *.txt files in your run.prm file.
* `sc_init` sanity check for your initial conditions file. Given the prey densities/C and MUM values 
in your initial conditions file the required growth per group and ageclass (growth needed to 
grow from ageclass i to ageclass i+1) is compared to the realised growth given your initial conditions file.
* `plot_sc_init` multiply your initial values for MUM and C and visualise the effect on the 
realised growth compared to the required growth.
* `sc_overlap` calculate the spatial overlap (horizontal and vertical) for each predator and 
prey combination throughout your simulation. The overlap is based on the Schoner index which 
is 1 for perfect overlap and 0 for no overlap at all.

# atlantistools 0.3.1.9000
## New features
* `plot_species()` is based on the species-specific overview plots used at CSIRO and Ifremer (Raphael).
For each age-structured group (10 ageclasses) the biomass, individual weight, numbers and condition 
are shown per age for the model simulation.

## Minor improvements
* `combine_groups()` can be used to combine different grouping variables within a plot to a `Rest-group`.
Assume you want to visualise the feeding interactions of species x. The prey groups are usually
mapped to colors in `atlantistool`. For some groups there might be high number of prey organisms (e.g. 20+).
Therefore color-coding becomes as hassle. You can use the `combine_groups()` function to gather all
groups with a low contribution to the overall value to a `Rest` group to minimise the number of
grouping variables resulting in fewer colors in the final plot. The function is build into the `plot_diet()`
function but can be used in other occasions as well.
* `convert_time()` now converts timesteps/days to years. You can still convert to time in date-format.
In this case set `as_date` to `TRUE` and pass the `modelstart` as usual. By default `as_date` is `FALSE`
in the new version of the package. You might need to adjust this in your plotting routines.

# atlantistools 0.3.0.9000
## New features
* `plot_diet()` This functions replaces `plot_dietcheck()`. The resulting plot will give an indication
about feeding interactions for each functional group. The upper panel shows the feeding interaction
from the predator perspective while the lower panel focuses on the prey perspective. You can either 
pass data from the DietCheck.txt or the SpecMort.txt file. In the first case the plots are faceted according
to the habitat while in the latter case plots are either faceted by ageclass or stanza. 
* `combine_ages()` can be used to convert ageclass to stanzas (juvenile/adult). Currently this only works
for groups with exactly 10 ageclasses. The stanzas are split according to the age_mat parameter in
the biological parameterfile. You can apply this function to convert the ageclass based specific mortality
data to stanzas in order to simplify your plotting routines/anaylsis of the feeding interactions.
* `load_spec_mort()` allows the extraction of predation mortalities from the SpecMort.txt file. The data is
stored in the overall summary list generated with `preprocess()`. In order to guarantee the highest amount
of flexibility in further analysis the data is not aggregated in any way. You may choose to aggregate
ageclasses to stanzas with `combine_ages()` if you please. The addition of this file might blow up
the resulting *.rda but the filesize should still be easily manageable (1GB *.nc and 100MB SpecMort.txt 
are stored as 30MB *.rda).

# atlantistools 0.2.0.9000

## New features
* `combine_runs()` can be used to combine preprocessed data created with `preprocess()` from different 
Atlantis simulations. The model output can be compared with the vignette code `model-comparison.Rmd`.
* The vignette `model-calibration.Rmd` can be used to create various model calibration and tuning plots
for a single simulation. The vignette can be used as blueprint for different Atlantis models. Simply
download the vignette code, change the first section where the data is read in to your likings,
modify the plot dimensions and you are good to go.
* Added `model-comparison.Rmd` to compare multiple Atlantis simulations. It works very similar to
`model-calibration.Rmd`.

## Minor improvements
* `load_dietcheck()` and `load_rec()` are incorporated into `preprocess()`. The resulting dataframe are now
part of the output and can be accessed directly from the list via `out$diet` and `out$ssb_rec`.
`convert_factor()` was overhauled. Due to the inclusion of `load_dietcheck()` there
is no more `Rest` group when the name conversion is performed.
* `convert_time()` can now handle different input formats without any user specifications.
* Added vignette `model-calibration` to automatically build a pdf document with various plotting routines
used for model tuning and calibration.

* `plot_boxes()` 
* `plot_calibrate()` 
* `plot_dietcheck()` 
* `plot_flux()` 
* `plot_physics()` 
* `plot_rec()` 
* `plot_struct()`

# atlantistools 0.0.0.9000

## New features

* `load_fgs()` Read in the functional group file as dataframe.
* `load_bps()` Extracts the names of the epibenthic biomasspools from the initial conditions file.
* `load_box()` Load the box specification file (*.bgm) for an Atlantis scenario.
* `load_nc()` Read in data from Atlantis netcdf output files. Currently the general and the 
production outputfile are supported. In addition the following variables can be read in:
"N", "Nums", "ResN", "StructN", "Eat", "Growth", "Prodn" and "Grazing". Please only pass one
variable per function call. 
* `load_nc_physics()` Read in physical data from Atlantis netcdf output file. Works very
similar like load_nc.
* `load_dietcheck()` Read in data from the `DietCheck.txt` output file. Currently only models based on the
`bec_dev` branch are supported due to differences in data structure with `trunc` models.
* `load_rec()` Read in data from the `*SSB.txt` and `*YOY.txt` output files. 
* `plot_calibrate()` Plot relative timeseries of various variables (E.g. biomass@age, 
weight@age). The start of the model run is used as reference point.
* `preprocess()` Various model specifications are read in from the ncdf-output files
and aggregated with different levels of complexity. (E.g. biomass per species, time and ageclass
or biomass per species, time and box). The data can be stored in a *.rda file to save
storage on harddisc. The function returns a list of dataframes which all have the same structure.
This function should be executed before you start plotting as most of the plotting routines 
pull out the data from this file/object.
* `agg_mean()` Aggregate data using dplyr functionality. This is basically a wrapper
for 'group_by' followed by 'summarise'.
* `agg_sum()` See 'agg_mean' for further details. The summary function used her is 'sum'.

## Minor improvements

* `convert_path()` Allows users to use the model with either one model folder or multiple
model folders (e.g. one main model folder and an extra folder for model output). I highly 
recommend to store all the data in one folder because then you only have to supply the
directory once and can acces all files using only the filename. If you are using multiple
files you always have to pass the complete folder/filename-string as filename and set
the 'dir' paramater to NULL.
* `convert_bgm()` Convert `*.bgm` file to a dataframe using a spatial projection.
* `convert_factor()` Convert species names in output files to long names. Therefore the plots all
use the same labeling. Simply change the values in your `functionalGroups.csv` file in the column `LongName` 
if you want to change the names.
* `convert_time()` Convert from timestep (either as integer or number of days) to actual time.
* `get_boundary()` Extract the boundary boxes from the list of boxinfos generated with 'load_box()'. 
* `get_conv_mgnbiot()` Extract the conversionfactor to convert data from mg nitrogen to biomass in t
from the biol*.prm file.
* `get_groups()` Collection of similar functions to extract specific
#' columns from the Atlantis functionalGroups.csv file. (E.g. cohort-groups, acronyms, group names ...)
* `theme_atlantis` Customised ggplot2 theme used in every plot.
