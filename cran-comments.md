## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 


There were 2 NOTEs:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
  Maintainer: 'Alexander Keth <alexander.keth@uni-hamburg.de>'
  
This is my first CRAN submission.

* checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is  5.7Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    doc       1.6Mb
    extdata   3.0Mb

Example input files are drastically reduced in size (from more than 200MB down to 3MB).
