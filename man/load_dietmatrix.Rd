\title{Extract the dietmatrix from the biological parameterfile}
\usage{
load_dietmatrix(dir = getwd(), prm_biol, fgs)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Character string giving the path of the Atlantis model folder.
If data is stored in multiple folders (e.g. main model folder and output
folder) you should use 'NULL' as dir.}

\item{prm_biol}{Character string giving the filename of the biological
parameterfile. Usually "[...]biol_fishing[...].prm". In case you are using
multiple folders for your model files and outputfiles pass the complete
folder/filename string and set dir to 'NULL'.}

\item{fgs}{Character string giving the filename of 'functionalGroups.csv'
file. In case you are using multiple folders for your model files and
outputfiles pass the complete folder/filename string as fgs.
In addition set dir to 'NULL' in this case.}
}
\value{
dataframe of the availability matrix in long format with columns
pred, pred_stanza (1 = juvenile, 2 = adult), prey_stanza, prey, avail, code.
}
\description{
Extracts the diet matrix as long dataframe from the biological paremeter file
of any ATLANTIS simulation.
}
\examples{
d <- system.file("extdata", "setas-model-new-becdev", package = "atlantistools")
head(load_dietmatrix(dir = d, prm_biol = "VMPA_setas_biol_fishing_New.prm", fgs = "SETasGroups.csv"), n = 10)
